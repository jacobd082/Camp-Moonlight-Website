            <h1>Mob Information</h1>
            <p>To provide you some information before Camp Moonlight is released, I thought it would be fun to share the current mobs that I have in the game.</p>
            <p>After venturing deep into the forest, something bizarre happens. All of the sudden, the grass and trees turn purple. Enemies roam freely and jump towards you.</p>
            <h2>Slimes</h2>
            <p>A classic in pixel video games, Slimes are small creatures with good intentions, they are happy to be visited. However, their slimy flesh burns the human skin.</p>
            <h2>The Shadowman</h2>
            <p>A shy figure of the shadowman will quickly and quietly move towards any unwanted attention. He likes to stay out of where he can be seen. He used to be a human like you and me, but after an event that forced him out of society, The Shadowman hides his face in a cloak with only his bright green eyes visible</p>
            <h2>The Lurker</h2>
            <p>The same purple color as the decay grass, The lurker is a small flying disk that stays in place until awoke. Once it senses your presence, it's beat red eye opens as it lurches towards you.</p>
